            <i>Cult of the Lamb</i>, from indie darling <a href="https://massivemonster.co" target="_blank">Massive Monster</a>, demands your attention. Yes, it's not for everyone. It's for you, with a taste for the eccentric and a hunger for indie games that last longer than one sitting. It's time to pick up the controller.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Before I stepped in, I had no idea the fundamental structure of this game starts with <i>Binding of Isaac</i>. Each dungeon is laid out with that familiar, minimal room design packed with mysterious characters. But now, the universe of the game has life beyond combat. After each dungeon crawl, whether you survive or die, you return to a homebase (think: <i>Harvest Moon</i> but with a rate of excrement to rival a closet full of old Tamogatchis).
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Bottom line, for about ⅓ the $ of a AAA game, we have a fresh mix of real time strategy, base building, and of course, the thing that cements it all &mdash; roguelike deckbuilding combat sequences. And by the 10<sup>th</sup> hour, the attention to detail really helps to keep the experience going, with exceptional music direction, a bouncy cartoon-but-not-<i>Flash</i> artstyle, and a seriously good unlock curve for its many skill trees.
            
            Plus, there's replay value, with a cute and surprisingly complex "daily routine" gameplay loop &mdash; aspects that remind me of <i>Animal Crossing</i>, from hell.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And yes, maybe spending all day today with <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> has me speaking idiomatically as a fluffy pagan warlord. <i>Devolver Digital</i> &mdash; a publisher so bombastically ostentatious, and yet, so utterly of the people. I can only hope this latest classic-in-the-making represents yet one of many peaks to come.

            I was drawn into this <i>Slay the Spire</i>-like deckbuilding roguelike when I read it supported co-op. From the first moment, two things became clear &mdash; this game does not look good in 4k, and this game feels ripped right out of the <a href="https://www.battleon.com/" target="_blank">AdventureQuest</a> universe.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            After one battle, I was brought into the "Town," which reminded me of a point-and-click adventure. A shop, an upgrade station, plot points... this is richer, with more to customize and change my experience, than a single floor in the archetypal <i>Slay the Spire</i> or <i>Dicey Dungeons</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, I favor the art and focus of the classics, but should return to this when wishing for a story and online co-op teamwork.
